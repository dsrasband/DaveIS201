                        <p>Here are some of the skills I've acquired thus far, along with some things I enjoy learning about and activities I love to do.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spanish
                                <ul>
                                    While I was serving as a volunteer missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
                                    Saints in Panama, I learned how to speak Spanish.  Since returning home, I've maintained the
                                    ability to speak, understand, read, and write, and have loved using these skills to foster and
                                    build new relationships.
                                </ul>

                                Web development
                                <ul>
                                    During my sophomore year at BYU, I took an intro to information sytems class where I was introduced
                                    to the world of web development.  I've since enjoyed learning how to code in html and css to complete
                                    assignments and build new websites and I'm excited to continue to develop these skills.
                                </ul>
                            </li><br>

                                Real Estate
                                <ul>
                                    I'm fascinated by using real estate as a way to build long-term wealth and streams of
                                    passive income.  This interest began last year when I worked alongside my dad to fix and flip a townhouse,
                                    as well as find several buy-and-hold properties.  This is something I want to continue to learn about
                                    throughout my life, and I hope to use my knowledge to build a portfolio that can bless my family and those
                                    around me. 
                                </ul>
                            </li><br>

                                Mountain and Water Sports
                                <ul>
                                    All my life I've loved spending time in the mountains.  I grew up hiking, skiing, mountain biking,
                                    and rock climbing, and love doing all of those things to this day.  Participating in these activities with
                                    my family has given us so many memories and has made us so close.  We also love spending time
                                    on the lake together waterskiing, wakeboarding, and wakesurfing behind a boat.  It's so much fun, and I know 
                                    that this will always be a part of my life.  
                                </ul>

                                Self-improvement
                                <ul>
                                    I love the idea of becoming a better person each and every day, and have committed myself to a journey of lifelong
                                    improvement.  I live an active lifestyle, and strive to take care of my body through consistent exercise and healthy
                                    eating.  I'm also passionate about feeding my mind, and love to listen to self-improvement books as I drive around
                                    each day.  Some of my favorites include "Rich Dad, Poor Dad," by Robert Kiyosaki, "Atomic Habits," by James Clear, 
                                    "The Compound Effect," by Darren Hardy, and "The Go-Giver" by Bob Burg and John David Mann.  I'm always looking to 
                                    add books to my reading list, if you have any suggestions send them my way!
